# Advent of Code 2024

If someone happens to be here: Hello!

This is my Laravel project for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/).

I play around with Laravel and PHP. Some answers, variables, functions, methods, etc. may be dum or rushed.

If you like make an issue and suggest me some improvements.

**Lets have fun!**

Disclaimers:
* Code will be messy
* Code will be dum
* Code may or may be smart
* I may refactor some stuff
* Contains answers
